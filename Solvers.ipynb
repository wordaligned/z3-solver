    "The knapsack problem is an important optimisation problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's not just about packing things. Many similar problems have the same solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples:\n",
    "- A family is dining out on a budget. Everyone has their favourite starter, main, desert. What will they order?\n",
    "- The product manager has a delivery date and a list of features. Each feature has a cost (story points) and a value. We know the team velocity. What's the plan?\n",
    "\n",
    "![Menu choice](menu.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "For real life problems, there will be extra constraints. E.g. everyone gets a main course, or some choices are sold out. For the product, maybe we have to include the \"user registration\" feature, or features might be inter-dependent ...\n",
    "\n",
    "These constraints can be added without needing to modify the solver. In fact, they help the solver get an answer! Typically with real world problems the variables are not truly independent. Because of this a solution which is expensive to calculate, in theory, can be found in practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other problems well suited to solvers include dependency management, scheduling, routing ...\n",
    "\n",
    "Note also that a generic solver may not be the best route to an answer. In the case of the knapsack problem there are more specialised (and efficient) algorithms. It is possible to configure and extend generic solvers too, e.g. to favour particular strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're interested in how SMT solvers work, SAT solvers are a good starting point. SAT solvers determine if a set of expressions using boolean variables can be _satisfied_. [MiniSAT](http://minisat.se/) is a minimalistic production quality SAT solver developed for expositional purposes."
